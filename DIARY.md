I can't conduct the commonTest.
So, I reinstall `java-21-openjdk-devel` with `sudo dnf install java-21-openjdk-devel -y` (according to ChatGPT) <br>
With that, I can have the `javac` command (For Java Compiler)

Ditching the idea of setting JAVA_HOME env for the project cuz it'll be a manuel config on every other machine.<br>
I'll just let Android Studio handle that.

The command can be run after typing the correct command `:composeApp:conectedAndroidTest` instead of `:composeApp`***/***`conectedAndroidTest`
